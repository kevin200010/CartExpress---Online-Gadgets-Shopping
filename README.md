This coursework or the project is about building a website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This coursework was given to us as the final coursework of this module i.e., Information Systems for the first year. The main objective of this website is to understand the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. After completing this project, we as a student are supposed to be able to design the website with available tools and technologies. This coursework focused on creating an eCommerce website for any business, and I have developed one for selling electronic gadgets like phones, tablets, computers, etc. With this website, the consumers do not have to visit markets by themselves but can know almost anything about their desired products and buy from home with just a few clicks. This coursework was completed by creating ten different webpages. CSS and JavaScript were also used to decorate the site and to make the site functioning. The whole work was done in software called “Sublime,” which was efficient to use.
